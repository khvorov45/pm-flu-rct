[] Seroconversion model: note that higher titres are probably less likely to
increase by a factor of 4.
[] Seroprotection model: only makes sense for those who start below 40.

[x] Unajusted table with p-values: added. Note interpretation.
[x] Remove variables: done. Can add back in if needed.
[x] Titre table from model: does not make sense because less informative
than parameter estimates and also less informative than the unadjusted table.
